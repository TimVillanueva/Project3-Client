### Backend Goals
Users will be able to search a database of listings in their area, create their own event listing, and save listings to their profile. Users will also be able to leave comments/reviews that all other users can see and create an account to save all their data. 

### Frontend Goals
Users will be able to navigate a map of listings using specified criteria. Users will be able to get detailed information and leave comments on listings, as well as mark them as attending. Users will have delightfully styled login, logout, signup, and profile pages

### Technical Specifications
This project will utilize the PERN stack to navigate Mapbox or another geolocation library. The site will use JWT Auth to secure user events to protect editing from outside users.
